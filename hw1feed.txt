post: hello! should we hand in a pdf with parts 6, 7, and 8 or should we hand in hw0.py, hw0.txt, and our screenshot? the instructions for the homework says the following:  &gt; Attach a single document (PDF preferred), containing &gt; A screenshot of running your edited hw0.py (part 6) &gt; Text you write for parts 7 and 8, in hw0.txt  &gt; To turn it in on Canvas, visit the course page, click on assignments, find hw0, and upload hw0.py, hw0.txt, and your screenshot.  not quite sure which set of instructions to follow. thank you in advance! :blush:

post: that should be okay. It used Python 3, which is what matters most. Some of the readings may not line up perfectly (and some of the review questions will be different), so just be aware of that when I suggest readings

post: <@U7AAFRR51> if you visit your repository on the hcde310 GitHub (probably called hw0-&lt;yourgithubusername&gt;) you should be able to view the contents of hw0 online and you can check if it's the code you wanted uploaded!

post: One other note — DRS is looking for at least two notetakers to assist a student this quarter. Please consider notetaking as it will help your peer gain access to material from class. Notetakers will receive a letter of recommendation for their service from the Director of Disability Resources for Students when the quarter is complete.  (I also think that taking notes meant to be understandable by others can also be a valuable exercise for yourself.)  Now that you all know the structure of the class, and the general plan to make most slides available before class starts, please consider this request and message me privately if you’d be willing to help take notes.
