# Homework 1
Due 	Monday, October 9, 5pm

What to hand in via Canvas and GitHub Classroom
1. hw1-part1.py
2. hw1-part2.py
3. hw1-part3.py

## Part 1 - List and String operations
At the top of the file hw1-part1.py, you should find the following two lines:

```python
lst = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
s = "This is my HCDE310 test string"
```

In the hw1-part1.py file, add code to do the exercises as instructed in the code file.

From a terminal (or from PyCharm) execute the hw1-part1.py file.

## Part 2: Exercises
See the instructions in hw2-part2.py. Your output should look something like:

## Part 3: Counting lines, characters, and words
See the instructions in hw2-part3.py

Here is an example of what your output for this should look like, on hw2feed.txt:

## Just For Fun 1: Modify your code from part 3 to count only the lines with posts, not the lines with authors.
(remember, you don't need to do just for fun exercises)

Youâ€™ll need to use conditionals and find() or slices for this.  See exercise 6 for some ideas.

## Just for Fun 2: Most common word in Sherlock Holmes?
We haven't covered everything you need in Python to do this yet (in particular, we haven't talked about dictionaries yet). But think about how a program could figure out what was the most common word in a document, say the Sherlock Holmes text that I provide with this homework (sherlock.txt). Thinking about this problem now will help you appreciate the value of dictionaries when we learn about them next week.
